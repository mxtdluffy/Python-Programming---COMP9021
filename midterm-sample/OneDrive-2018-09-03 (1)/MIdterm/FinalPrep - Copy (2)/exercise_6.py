    Finds all numbers i and j with a <= i <= j <= b such that:
    - i + j is even;
    - when read from left to right, the digits in i are strictly increasing
    - when read from left to right, the digits in j are strictly decreasing
    - when read from left to right, the digits in the average of i and j are
      either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing

    Outputs the solutions from smallest i to largest i,
